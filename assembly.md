# Assembly Protocol: Directive Coordinates

Fragments from the Echo streams must be re-sequenced.
The corrupted timeline requires a precise order for validation.

**TO ASSEMBLE THE SOLUTION KEY:**

1.  **START with the Primary Log Index.**
    * (Found in `log_404.txt` filename and content)
    * **VALUE TO USE: 404**

2.  **NEXT, APPEND the Anomaly Signature.**
    * (Detected in `signal.wav` spectrogram and `_FRACTURED_LINE_` from `log_404.txt` output)
    * **VALUE TO USE: FRACTURE**

3.  **FINALLY, APPEND the Deployment Build ID.**
    * (Located in `log_404.txt` metadata/comment `// Build: X.Y.Z`)
    * **VALUE TO USE: 713**

Combine these three elements **exactly in this order, without any spaces, underscores, or other separators.**

The resulting sequence is the **"solution"** mentioned in the Protocol Verification.
