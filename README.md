# sector7b_dump

A data dump retrieved from unstable sector logs.  
Do not attempt to reconstruct.  
They are listening.

---

They fractured the data, not the language.  
Start where the echoes distort â€” in the lines they removed.  
Only those who can see patterns in the static will find the line unbroken.

Use base64 when things look scrambled.  
Use spectrogram when they sound wrong.  
Use your eyes when nothing else helps.

-- E.C.H.O.
